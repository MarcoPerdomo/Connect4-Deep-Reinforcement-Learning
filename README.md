# Connect4-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning

V1.0 - Alpha version

Play and train Connect 4 in Python using a Reinforcement Learning AI

A deep reinforcement learning AI is trained to play the game. Two ways of training the RL AI are explored. The first of them is to train the RL-AI by playing against the scoring-based AI. The second method is to train the RL AI by playing against another RL-AI. For this last method, after several batches of training, the ‘winning’ RL-AI is selected. The rewards, batches of learning and other hyperparameters are tuned to determine the best performing architecture. 

Futher changes will be commited in the future.
